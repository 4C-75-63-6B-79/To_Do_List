# To_Do_List
-Tired to make it look and work like a google keep thing.
-Lot of code can be removed as lot of is rewritten several times
-Things will be better if I reorganize it. 
-The priority thing is not added so sorry
-Styling has error if a large task in entered then the box may look as if it is cutting the task 
-Added the local storage thing but don't know why it reorder the list. Fixed this by sorting the keys when taken from the local storage
-This is not good work and can be made much better so sorry for disappointing
